Welcome to Number Guessing Game.
Number Guessing Game generates a random number between 1 and 100.
It is your job to guess the number.
You will be asked to guess a number. If your guess was the number,
you win. Otherwise, you will be told whether your guess was too
high, too low and if your guess was within 10 numbers of the random
number.
